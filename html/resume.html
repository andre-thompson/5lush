<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Pokemon Red with Reinforcement Learning</h3>
This project addresses reinforcement learning by modifying a pre-existing Pokemon Red agent. This agent uses Stable Baselines Q-Learning algorithm with TensorBoard. The goal of this agent is to defeat the Pewter City and Cerulean City gym leaders aquiring their badges. Using the PyBoy emulator, the agent is positively rewarded to capture and record all new screens visited, incentivising the agent to explore the map.
<h3>5lush.com</h3>
The purpose of this website is to promote music for the artist 5lush and host my personal portfolio and blog. The website design is written in html and css inspired by late 90s and early 2000s internet aesthetic. The backend is written in JavaScript and enteracts with Spotify's Web API to provide various services. The entire website is self hosted on a raspberry pi with a custom domain name and a self signed security certificate.
