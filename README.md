The purpose of this project is to create a cohesive and dynamic website for my friend the music artist 5lush. This website has a javascript backend that interacts with Spotify's Web API. This data is parsed in many different ways and in some cases sorted using a Merge Sort function. This data is then sent to the frontend using express. The frontend is made with HTML and inline javascript as well as CSS for dynamic styling. The website is currently hosted on a single Raspberry Pi 5 but I look to upgrade soon.
