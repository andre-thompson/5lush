#### Project Purpose
 

The purpose of this project is to create a cohesive and dynamic website for my friend the music artist 5lush. This website has a javascript backend that interacts with Spotify's Web API. The frontend is made with HTML and CSS. The website is currently hosted on a single Raspberry Pi 5 but I look to upgrade soon. The styling is directly influenced by the 'Golden Age' of websites from the 1990s to early 2000s, many gifs and jpgs are directly sourced from GeoCities archives.
